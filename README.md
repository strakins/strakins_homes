Click Here to [Visit Strakins Homes](https://strakins-homes.vercel.app/)

The strakins homes app is real estate App that can be adapted to any city across the globe with real estate API

It aims to solve the issues of residents who wishes to purchase or rent an apartment within thier state of residence. 

```
Additionally, the website was developed sequel to an online curated tutorial on NextJs that I took to serve as an indication of clear understanding of NextJs and its dependencies.  
It easy to navigate, user friendly and responsive.

##Features of the App

The App allows you see a list of available homes for rentage and purchase

It has a Search Page with several filtering functionalities.

##Runnng Project Locally

First clone from the repo: git clone "https://github.com/strakins/strakins_homes"

Subsequently,

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
